# Building a Retro Portfolio

This portfolio is inspired by the aesthetic of the original Apple Macintosh from 1984. The design uses:

- **Chicago Kare font**: A faithful reproduction of Susan Kare's original Chicago typeface made by <a href='https://chicagokare.xyz/' target='_blank'>Duane King</a>.
- **Black and white only**: No colors, just like the original Mac.
- **Simple layouts**: Grid-based, functional design.

## Why Retro?

There's something beautiful about the constraints of early computing. When you only have black and white pixels, every design decision matters. The Chicago font was specifically designed for screen legibility at low resolutions.

## Technical Stack

Built with:

- Astro
- TypeScript
- CSS (no frameworks)

Sometimes less is more.
